# ExpenseTracker
This personal project is used as a means to showcase my skills in creating CRUD systems. Furthermore it will showcase skills on creating a database scheme from scratch, as well as using the data to implement charts for data visualization. This application will also have important aspects used, such as password hashing and authentication.
